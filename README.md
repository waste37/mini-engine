# Mini Engine

Mini Engine is a personal project where I experiment with a simple yet flexible **Entity-Component System (ECS)** and a **deferred shading pipeline**.

## Objectives

1. Maintain a **small and contained** codebase.
2. Implement features in the **simplest and most specific way** possible.
3. Ensure a **simple data layout** that allows for **fast iteration**.

## Roadmap

### Core Features
- [ ] **Entity-Component System (ECS)**
    - [ ] CRUD operations for entities and components
    - [ ] Component-based iterators/views
- [ ] **World Definitions**
    - [ ] Load world configurations from a JSON file
- [ ] **Deferred Shading Renderer**
    - [ ] Load models from JSON specifications
    - [ ] Load textures from JSON specifications
    - [ ] Implement a deferred shading pipeline
    - [ ] Add camera controls (mouse + keyboard)
- [ ] **Optimization**
    - [ ] Basic frustum culling

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Implement shadow mapping
- [ ] Add a basic **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** material system
